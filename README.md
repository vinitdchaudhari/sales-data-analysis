ðŸš€ *New Project Alert!* ðŸš€
I am thrilled to share my collaborative project : an *Amazon Sales Dashboard* created using Power BI! This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into our sales performance, helping us make informed, data-driven decisions. Here are the key highlights and the steps involved in building this dashboard:
Steps Involved :
1. *Data Collection:* Gathered sales data from web.
2. *Data Cleaning:* Processed the data to remove any inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors to ensure data accuracy.
3. *Data Modeling:* Structured the data to create relationships between different data sets for comprehensive analysis.
4. *Visualization Design:* Used Power BI to create intuitive and interactive visualizations to represent key metrics and insights.
5. *Dashboard Development:* Assembled the visualizations into a cohesive dashboard layout, ensuring it is user-friendly and informative.
6. *Testing and Validation:* Tested the dashboard for accuracy and performance, and validated the insights with stakeholders.

This dashboard not only visualizes key sales data but also highlights areas for improvement and growth opportunities. I am incredibly proud of the collaborative effort that went into developing this powerful tool.
